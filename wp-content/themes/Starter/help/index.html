  <h4 id="terms-one">CMS</h4>
  <p>A Content Management System, or CMS, is software for facilitating the maintenance of content, but not design, on a web site. A blogging tool is an example of a Content Management System. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-two">Wordpress</h4>
  <p>WordPress is an open source blog publishing application powered by PHP and MySQL which can also be used for basic content management. Used at almost 2% of the 10,000 biggest websites, Wordpress is the most popular blog software in use today.</p>
  <h4 id="terms-three">Dashboard</h4>
  <p>The Dashboard tells you about recent activity both at your site and in the WordPress community at large.</p>
  <h4 id="terms-four">Modules</h4>
  <p>Modules are simply sections of content displayed on the admin screen.</p>
  <h4 id="terms-five">Posts</h4>
  <p>Posts are the entries that display in reverse chronological order on your home page. In contrast to pages, posts usually have comments fields beneath them and are included in your site's RSS feed.</p>
  <h4 id="terms-six">Pages</h4>
  <p>In WordPress, you can write either posts or pages. When you're writing a regular blog entry, you write a post. Posts automatically appear in reverse chronological order on your blog's home page. Pages, on the other hand, are for content such as "About Me," "worContact Me," etc. Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology, and are often used to present information about yourself or your site that is somehow timeless -- information that is always applicable. You can use Pages to organize and manage any amount of content. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-seven">Categories</h4>
  <p>Each post in WordPress is filed under a category. Thoughtful categorization allows posts to be grouped with others of similar content and aids in the navigation of a site. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-eight">Tags</h4>
  <p> A tag is a keyword which describes all or part of a Post. Think of it like a Category, but smaller in scope. A post may have several tags, many of which relate to it only peripherally. Like Categories, Tags are usually linked to a page which shows all posts having the same tag. Unlike Categories, Tags can be created on-the-fly, by simply typing them into the tag field. </p>
  <p>Many people confuse Tags and Categories, but the difference is easy: Categories generally don't change often, while your Tags usually change with every Post. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-nine">Widgets</h4>
  <p>Widgets are gadgets or gizmos that allow you to add various pieces of information to your Theme's sidebar content. Widgets, for example, can be used to add Categories, Archives, Blogroll, Recent Posts, and Recent Comments to your sidebar. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-ten">Comments</h4>
  <p>Comments are a feature of blogs which allow readers to respond to posts. Typically readers simply provide their own thoughts regarding the content of the post, but users may also provide links to other resources, generate discussion, or simply compliment the author for a well-written post. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-eleven">Plugins</h4>
  <p>A Plugin is a group of php functions that can extend the functionality present in a standard WordPress site. These functions may all be defined in one php file, or maybe spread among more than one file. Usually, a plugin is a php file that can be uploaded to the "wp-content/plugins" directory on your webserver, where you have installed WordPress. Once you have uploaded the plugin file, you should be able to "turn it on" or Enable it from the "Plugins" page in the administration interface of your weblog. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-twelve">Themes</h4>
  <p>A theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. A theme modifies the way the weblog is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. </p>
  <h4 id="terms-thirteen">RSS</h4>
  <p>"Really Simple Syndication": a format for syndicating many types of content, including blog entries, torrent files, video clips on news-like sites; specifically frequently updated content on a Web site, and is also known as a type of "feed" or "aggregator". An RSS feed can contain a summary of content or the full text, and makes it easier for people to keep up to date with sites they like in an automated manner (much like e-mail). </p>
